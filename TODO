1) It might be a good idea to create setters for all the attributes of each object contained within
a firewall. This will prevent attributes from having illegal types, will ensure their values are in
the correct form (spelling, case, etc.), and will ensure legal values. This will take the logic for
setting attributes out of multiple places in the code and put in it one, self contained method.

2) Need to modify configconverter.py so the OS versions have a legitimate input instead of the test
names I have as placeholders right now. Should look something like
OSNAME-MAJORVERSION.MINORVERSION.BUILD and we can parse accordingly.

3) Adding logging to the code would be useful for debugging purposes. Would need a parent logger in
firewalls.py, with child loggers for each of the separate files/modules. Send all logging levels to
a file, and only INFO or above to console.

4) Bolster Cisco ASA ACL parsing code to handle more edge cases

5) Perhaps use python's IP library for all ip addresses/masks, instead of just storing them as
strings.

6) Write firewall method to find all ACLs and ACL rules that effect a particular IP address
